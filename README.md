# AI_Model_Training
Car Price prediction with Regression algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Ridge, Lasso and SVR
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate the implementation of 
various machine learning algorithms using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm and provides a step-by-step guide along with code examples.

Algorithms Covered

1.Decision Trees
2. Random Forests
3. Support Vector Regression (SVM)
4. Ridge
5. Lasso

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
